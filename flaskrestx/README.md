To run these tests, you would need to:

Save this test file in the same directory as your ragflow-flask-restx-wrapper.py file.

Install the required dependencies (flask, flask-restx, requests).

Run the tests using the command: ```python -m unittest test_ragflow_api.py```



Note that these tests focus on the API wrapper's functionality and assume that the underlying RAGFlow API is working correctly.

see .env , .env.example

In a real-world scenario, you might want to add more edge cases, error handling tests, and possibly integration tests that interact with the actual RAGFlow API.
